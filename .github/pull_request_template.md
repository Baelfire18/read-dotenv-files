## Adding a new language

- [ ] I have created a folder with the name of the language
- [ ] Inside of that folder, I have created a `main` file with my code that:
  - [ ] Imports the library (if needed)
  - [ ] Reads the ".env" file
  - [ ] Extracts the "DB_NAME" variable and  saves it
  - [ ] Prints the saved variable
- [ ] Inside of that folder, I have created a `ReadMe.md` file that contains:
  - [ ] An explaination of how to setup the language
  - [ ] An explaination of how to dowload the library (if needed)
  - [ ] An example of the code 
- [ ] I have updated the main [ReadMe](https://github.com/Baelfire18/read-dotenv-files#readme) to include the new language
- [ ] I have incremented the language count in the main [ReadMe](https://github.com/Baelfire18/read-dotenv-files#readme)
